<h1 align="center" id="title">Swarm Communication</h1>



<p id="description">Design of Swarm bot is an initiative towards the synchronized performance of multiple bots as a total system consisting huge numbers of plain real-time bots. It is observed that an expected group wise behavior is expressed from the interactions between the bots and the master device. The head posture movement is used to send the signal from the master device to communicate the slave devices. This methodology has come out in the field of artificial swarm intelligence as well as the bio-inspired researches of insects and other fields in nature with the occurrence of swarm behavior. This process depends on the master-slave concept to operate the whole system. The wireless communication utilizes the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol with radio waves in the range of 2.4-2.5 GHz. The ISM (Industrial Scientific Medical) band is used for the communication purpose.</p>

<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   In the battleground there are many hidden tunnels but the soldiers came to know the scenario inside of the tunnel using MASTER AND SALVE bots
*   In border areas 24hours surveillance is important for that the small slaves which is equipped by camera module can be used.
*   To reduce the death rate of soldiers they can use it in the battleground while firing with the enemies.
*   Same surveillance is applicable by the slaves for forest departments to reduce the animals poaching.
*   In medical those who are unable to change their location can use the Master Bot to change location.
